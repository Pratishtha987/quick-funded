Enhanced Profit Share: Starting with an impressive 80% profit share, you can enjoy a 5% increase, raising your profit share to 85% upon qualification. With continued success, your profit share can increase up to a remarkable 95%.`,

    question:
      "Will drawdown limits also increase as my balance increases by 25%?",
    answer: `
Yes, the drawdown limits will increase proportionally with the increased balance.

For example:

With a $100,000 account, your daily drawdown limit was $5,000 (5%) and your maximum drawdown was $10,000 (10%).

After scaling up to $125,000, your daily drawdown limit will increase to $6,250 (5%) and your maximum drawdown will increase to $12,500 (10%).

The daily drawdown limit will be 5% of the scaled-up equity, and the maximum drawdown will be 10% of the scaled balance.`,
